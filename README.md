# Transaction Sampling Project (Learning Exercise)

## Purpose
This project was created as a learning exercise to practice data sampling, summary statistics, and visualization in RStudio. It simulates a dataset of 1,000 transactions, draws a random sample, and analyzes average amounts by category.

## What it does
- Creates a mock dataset of transactions (Loans, Insurance, Rent, Restaurants, Entertainment).
- Randomly selects a sample of transactions for testing.
- Calculates summary statistics (average, min, max, count).
- Visualizes average amounts by category with bar charts.
- Demonstrates confidence intervals for averages.

## Tools Used
- RStudio
- dplyr (data manipulation)
- ggplot2 (visualization)

## Notes
This is not a professional analytics package — it’s a personal project to explore R coding concepts and connect them to audit/control analyst skills such as sampling, documentation, and KPI monitoring. 
In a real scenario a plot would not be made by random and extra items may be included such as confidence intervals.
